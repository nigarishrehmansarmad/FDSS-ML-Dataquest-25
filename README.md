# ML Challenge-BSAI Competition - 1st Place Winning Solution

## Overview
Thrilled to share that my teammates, Sajad Ali, Uroosha Zehra, and I secured 1st place in a prestigious machine learning competition with 26+ participating teams! This competition focused on predicting student outcomes using demographic, school, family, and assessment data from the Year 3 NAPLAN Writing test.

## Team Members
- [@Sajad Ali]()
- [@Uroosha Zehra Abidi](https://github.com/Uroosha4048)
- [@Nigarish Rehman Sarmad](https://github.com/nigarishrehmansarmad)

## Competition Objective
Predict which students will be at risk of underperforming in the Year 3 NAPLAN Writing test using a diverse dataset including literacy and numeracy assessments, socio-economic status, and other factors.

## Approach

### Data Preprocessing
- Imputed missing values using mean and median strategies.
- Encoded categorical variables effectively to ensure model readiness.
- Removed features with low correlation to the target to reduce noise.
- Scaled the data features for consistent ranges.
- Eliminated duplicate records to avoid bias.

### Model Training & Evaluation
- Tested multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, SVR, Random Forest Regressor, and XGBoost.
- Evaluated models using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- Selected the best performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## Achievements
- 1st place among 26+ teams, showcasing strong teamwork and innovative ML techniques.
- Gained hands-on experience applying diverse ML models to real-world educational data.
- Contributed to predictive analytics for education, providing insights to support at-risk students.
